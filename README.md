# exploding_dice_exploration
An exploration on the properties of exploding dice.

"Exploding" dice is a game mechanic that exists in certain dice-rolling role plaing games. Basically, whenever a player rolls a die and lands on the largest value of the die (e.g. 6 on a d6), the die is rolled again and the total is summed together.

This is an exploration as to how that changes the expectation of a die and the probabilities associated with beating certain Difficulty Checks (DCs).

The jupyter notebook is where you want to go to explore these results.
